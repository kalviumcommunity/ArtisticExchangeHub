# ArtisticExchangeHub


**Brief idea :**

So basically my idea is about buying and selling the art piece like portraits , landscapes,oil paintings etc.Then my website will generate a profile if you want to sell your art according to your work if you are a portrait artist then you many select the option specifically and give some photos about your work it will we displayed in your profile, this is about the selling and if you want to buy any art or you have to give an order for your portrait then  you can contact with any artist an make  an order. This was my idea for capstone.
